Executing the Regression testing on NEMO
Regression test is in a folder called coawst_regress_nemo
--------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS 
Python 2.6 & Above
Packages--> matplotlib for plotting and pdf generation

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING THE REGRESSION MODULE 

1. Execute by typing "nohup python run_coawst_regress.py &" 

2. The output would be is in "nohup.out" from the regression testing 

3. The post processing from the plotting part is in 
   "regress_pdf.pdf"

This nohup command would let the script run all the time even after
SSH logs out of nemo

--------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION OF THE PYTHON FILES

Inside the folder there is a sub-folder called coawst_regress_baseline
it has python files which are 

1. util.py     --> Fetches the source code from subversion client,
                   edits jobscript, bashfile, copies output

2. main.py     --> Calls each test case for running it on NEMO 
                   from its own separate ".py" file  

3. main_plot.py --> Calls each test case for plotting purposes  
                   and generates a pdf document. All cases have a
                   "_plot.py" file

4. __init__.py --> It connects all the python files together 
                   to form this package. Any changes made to any 
                   python file name should be modified in this file
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES 

1. WRF_Config_file --> Important folder that copies files to COAWST
distribution for WRF compilation

2. All the other .py files are for each case. One can comment some
cases or have all of them included by commenting/uncommenting them in 
main.py. 

3.The number of processors for each run can be changed inside each 
project's file. 

4. Check_queue() is the function in util.py that 
checks if each case is queued after ten minutes. There is a sleep time
of 10 secs in the same function prior to that. If a case immediately goes
out of the queue then we dont have waiting for 10 mins.
